 o Attempt to leave the room and choose "Where's Garnet?" when prompted.
 o Leave the room, run down the stairs, and talk to the guard on the right.
 o Go to the royal chamber (you have to talk to either of the 2 guards every time you want to enter the royal chamber, even if you are invited).
 o There will be a lot of dialogue once you enter; return to the guest room once it's over.
 o Head to the aircab dock after the meeting with Doctor Tot and fly to the Theater District.
 o Go the Tantalus hideout and get the Unusual Potion from Cinna; return to open the chests inside for some Gil.
 o Next visit Artist Michael's studio, ask about the potions, then search the studio for the Strange Potion and open the chest for a Lapis Lazuli.
 o Return to the aircab terminal and board an aircab for the Business District.
 o You can skip delivering Mogki's letter to Moodon at the inn, and do it after the challenge is over. So head straight to the market square.
 o Proceed down the alley and ask Alice about the potions to receive her Beautiful Potion.
 o Enter the synthesis shop to prepare not only another Cotton Robe trick, but also the less-known 'Desert Boots trick' :)
     BUY : 99 Cotton Robe      99,000
         : 99 Desert Boots     29,700
 o Ride back to Lindblum Castle and return to the royal chamber.
 o Following the upcoming meeting, take the lift to the base level and ride to the Serpent's Gate; open the chest and board the Blue Narciss.
 o Form a party with Vivi, Garnet and Quina, then sail west to the island with Chocobo tracks, west of the island with Chocobo's Lagoon.
 o Disembark, use Gysahl Greens to call Choco, and save your game.
  [TARGET TIME: 07:40:46]
 o Reset, enter Chocobo's Lagoon, dig up a Chocograph, and save on the beach outside. Be sure to save over a different file and check which Chocograph you received after you've already saved; you need either "Dawn Lagoon" or "Dusk Plains".
 o Play another game of Hot&Cold for the other Chocograph. Back outside, open the Chocograph menu to check whether you got the right one, and take the opportunity to equip "Dawn Lagoon".
 PATH C & COMBINED
  | * If you didn't get the second Chocograph Piece on Disc 1, then you'll  |
  |   need to dig it up now with one of the Chocographs!                    |
  | * The chances of digging up a Chocograph Piece AND the right Chocograph |
  |   in a single 30-second game are quite low, but they are highest in the |
  |   first game since you have two Chocographs which fit the requirements. |
  | * If you can't get a good Chocograph and the Chocograph Piece during    |
  |   the first game, then you can try to play 2 consecutive games instead. |
  | * Playing a second game immediately after another one adds about 0:30.  |
  |                                                         _________       |
  '--------------------------------------------------------/ + 0:30 /-------'

 o Don't bother saving after your last game; instead, head straight back to the
   Blue Narciss and sail to Chocobo's Forest. Use the tracks there to call
   Choco, then head east and into the water from the last beach - the "Dawn
   Lagoon" treasure is to the right of the island nearby.
 o Having gotten the Mountain Transformation, return to the beach and climb up
   the mountain to end up right next to Treno; enter the city.
 o Equip Quina with the Needle Fork, Bone Wrist, and Running Shoes; activate
   his/her Auto-Haste and Add Status abilities.
 o Save with Mogrich.
