PATH A, B & Lv 1
  | * If you have the time to spare (especially if you skipped the Promist Ring detour), then you can make the following area much easier.       |
  | * Enter Esto Gaza and proceed as normal, but return to the world map after the scenes are over.                                            |
  | * Equip Amarant with the Kaiser Knuckles, Green Beret, Bone Wrist, Power Vest, and Rebirth Ring; activate Auto-Life and Bird Killer.           |
  | * Remove the others' armor so that they can knock themselves out.       |
  | * Save near the beach, then encounter a Whale Zombie.                   |
  | * Hopefully it will open with Fin. Knock out everyone except Amarant, and hope for Zombie Powder. Attack once to finish the battle.         |
  | * Replace Amarant's Rebirth Ring with the Black Belt. Once you find the Red Hat in Mount Gulug, equip that as well and activate MP Attack.    |
  | * Revive Freya without healing her, and activate her Cover ability. You can equip the Linen Cuirass if necessary.                             |
  | * Ignore the upcoming equipment changes before the Red Dragon battles.  |
  | * With this set-up, you can easily get past the upcoming Red Dragon battles. Amarant can take them out in one hit each, so hope he gets a turn at the start of the battle and have him attack immediately.      |
  | * The remaining Red Dragon then has a 1 in 3 chance of using Dive. This will always hit and knock out Freya thanks to the Cover ability, and Amarant can attack again for the win.                                 |
  | * You can make up the missed AP gains by finding the Friendly Feather Circle near the Chocobo tracks and giving it a Moonstone.             |

BATTLE: RED DRAGON x 2
  | • This is the most annoying of the forced Red Dragon battles, so come armed with patience.                                                  |
  | • Cast Stop and attack with Freya and Amarant to Stop, Petrify or Venom them in any combination.                                              |
  | • Don't attack the same Red Dragon twice until you know whether the first attack connected - open a menu the moment someone's attack animation begins and wait for the result. This also keeps the enemies' ATB gauges from filling while you wait.                               |
  | • Keep Zidane on stand-by to throw Phoenix Down in case Dive connects, and make sure everyone except Vivi survives the battle to gain AP.    |

 o Dash back to Moolan and SAVE YOUR GAME!
  [TARGET TIME: 08:59:17]

 o Reload and slide down the rope to the bottom of the pit, then move toward
   the bottom of the screen to trigger the next battle.

  | • Use exactly the same strategy as before. At least this time you don't |
  |   have to worry about random battles on the way, and the attempts are   |
  |   shorter. The next and last Red Dragon battle is easy, so this is it!  |
